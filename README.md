# Task-4-Setup-and-Use-a-Firewall-on-Windows-Linux
In this task, I configured Windows Defender Firewall to manage network traffic. I listed current inbound and outbound rules, created a rule to block Telnet traffic on port 23, and tested the rule by attempting a connection. Finally, I documented the steps and commands used to configure the firewall, understanding its role in traffic filtering.
